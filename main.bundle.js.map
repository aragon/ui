For example, the CSS language definition\n\t\t * not only defines CSS highlighting for CSS documents, but also needs to define highlighting for CSS embedded\n\t\t * in HTML through `<style>` elements. To do this, it needs to modify `Prism.languages.markup` and add the\n\t\t * appropriate tokens. However, `Prism.languages.markup` is a regular JavaScript object literal, so if you do\n\t\t * this:\n\t\t *\n\t\t * ```js\n\t\t * Prism.languages.markup.style = {\n\t\t *     // token\n\t\t * };\n\t\t * ```\n\t\t *\n\t\t * then the `style` token will be added (and processed) at the end. `insertBefore` allows you to insert tokens\n\t\t * before existing tokens. For the CSS example above, you would use it like this:\n\t\t *\n\t\t * ```js\n\t\t * Prism.languages.insertBefore('markup', 'cdata', {\n\t\t *     'style': {\n\t\t *         // token\n\t\t *     }\n\t\t * });\n\t\t * ```\n\t\t *\n\t\t * ## Special cases\n\t\t *\n\t\t * If the grammars of `inside` and `insert` have tokens with the same name, the tokens in `inside`'s grammar\n\t\t * will be ignored.\n\t\t *\n\t\t * This behavior can be used to insert tokens after `before`:\n\t\t *\n\t\t * ```js\n\t\t * Prism.languages.insertBefore('markup', 'comment', {\n\t\t *     'comment': Prism.languages.markup.comment,\n\t\t *     // tokens after 'comment'\n\t\t * });\n\t\t * ```\n\t\t *\n\t\t * ## Limitations\n\t\t *\n\t\t * The main problem `insertBefore` has to solve is iteration order. Since ES2015, the iteration order for object\n\t\t * properties is guaranteed to be the insertion order (except for integer keys) but some browsers behave\n\t\t * differently when keys are deleted and re-inserted. So `insertBefore` can't be implemented by temporarily\n\t\t * deleting properties which is necessary to insert at arbitrary positions.\n\t\t *\n\t\t * To solve this problem, `insertBefore` doesn't actually insert the given tokens into the target object.\n\t\t * Instead, it will create a new object and replace all references to the target object with the new one. This\n\t\t * can be done without temporarily deleting properties, so the iteration order is well-defined.\n\t\t *\n\t\t * However, only references that can be reached from `Prism.languages` or `insert` will be replaced. I.e. if\n\t\t * you hold the target object in a variable, then the value of the variable will not change.\n\t\t *\n\t\t * ```js\n\t\t * var oldMarkup = Prism.languages.markup;\n\t\t * var newMarkup = Prism.languages.insertBefore('markup', 'comment', { ... });\n\t\t *\n\t\t * assert(oldMarkup !== Prism.languages.markup);\n\t\t * assert(newMarkup === Prism.languages.markup);\n\t\t * ```\n\t\t *\n\t\t * @param {string} inside The property of `root` (e.g. a language id in `Prism.languages`) that contains the\n\t\t * object to be modified.\n\t\t * @param {string} before The key to insert before.\n\t\t * @param {Grammar} insert An object containing the key-value pairs to be inserted.\n\t\t * @param {Object<string, any>} [root] The object containing `inside`, i.e. the object that contains the\n\t\t * object to be modified.\n\t\t *\n\t\t * Defaults to `Prism.languages`.\n\t\t * @returns {Grammar} The new grammar object.\n\t\t * @public\n\t\t */\n\t\tinsertBefore: function (inside, before, insert, root) {\n\t\t\troot = root || /** @type {any} */ (_.languages);\n\t\t\tvar grammar = root[inside];\n\t\t\t/** @type {Grammar} */\n\t\t\tvar ret = {};\n\n\t\t\tfor (var token in grammar) {\n\t\t\t\tif (grammar.hasOwnProperty(token)) {\n\n\t\t\t\t\tif (token == before) {\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfor (var newToken in insert) {\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tif (insert.hasOwnProperty(newToken)) {\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tret[newToken] = insert[newToken];\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t}\n\t\t\t\t\t\t}\n\t\t\t\t\t}\n\n\t\t\t\t\t// Do not insert token which also occur in insert.

Can be called without `new`.\n *\n * ##### presetName\n *\n * MarkdownIt provides named presets as a convenience to quickly\n * enable/disable active syntax rules and options for common use cases.\n *\n * - [\"commonmark\"](https://github.com/markdown-it/markdown-it/blob/master/lib/presets/commonmark.js) -\n *   configures parser to strict [CommonMark](http://commonmark.org/) mode.\n * - [default](https://github.com/markdown-it/markdown-it/blob/master/lib/presets/default.js) -\n *   similar to GFM, used when no preset name given. Enables all available rules,\n *   but still without html, typographer & autolinker.\n * - [\"zero\"](https://github.com/markdown-it/markdown-it/blob/master/lib/presets/zero.js) -\n *   all rules disabled. Useful to quickly setup your config via `.enable()`.\n *   For example, when you need only `bold` and `italic` markup and nothing else.\n *\n * ##### options:\n *\n * - __html__ - `false`. Set `true` to enable HTML tags in source. Be careful!\n *   That's not safe! You may need external sanitizer to protect output from XSS.\n *   It's better to extend features via plugins, instead of enabling HTML.\n * - __xhtmlOut__ - `false`. Set `true` to add '/' when closing single tags\n *   (`<br />`). This is needed only for full CommonMark compatibility. In real\n *   world you will need HTML output.\n * - __breaks__ - `false`. Set `true` to convert `\\n` in paragraphs into `<br>`.\n * - __langPrefix__ - `language-`. CSS language class prefix for fenced blocks.\n *   Can be useful for external highlighters.\n * - __linkify__ - `false`. Set `true` to autoconvert URL-like text to links.\n * - __typographer__  - `false`. Set `true` to enable [some language-neutral\n *   replacement](https://github.com/markdown-it/markdown-it/blob/master/lib/rules_core/replacements.js) +\n *   quotes beautification (smartquotes).\n * - __quotes__ - `“”‘’`, String or Array. Double + single quotes replacement\n *   pairs, when typographer enabled and smartquotes on. For example, you can\n *   use `'«»„“'` for Russian, `'„“‚‘'` for German, and\n *   `['«\\xA0', '\\xA0»', '‹\\xA0', '\\xA0›']` for French (including nbsp).\n * - __highlight__ - `null`. Highlighter function for fenced code blocks.\n *   Highlighter `function (str, lang)` should return escaped HTML. It can also\n *   return empty string if the source was not changed and should be escaped\n *   externaly. If result starts with <pre... internal wrapper is skipped.\n *\n * ##### Example\n *\n * ```javascript\n * // commonmark mode\n * var md = require('markdown-it')('commonmark');\n *\n * // default mode\n * var md = require('markdown-it')();\n *\n * // enable everything\n * var md = require('markdown-it')({\n *   html: true,\n *   linkify: true,\n *   typographer: true\n * });\n * ```\n *\n * ##### Syntax highlighting\n *\n * ```js\n * var hljs = require('highlight.js') // https://highlightjs.org/\n *\n * var md = require('markdown-it')({\n *   highlight: function (str, lang) {\n *     if (lang && hljs.getLanguage(lang)) {\n *       try {\n *         return hljs.highlight(lang, str, true).value;\n *       } catch (__) {}\n *     }\n *\n *     return ''; // use external default escaping\n *   }\n * });\n * ```\n *\n * Or with full wrapper override (if you need assign class to `<pre>`):\n *\n * ```javascript\n * var hljs = require('highlight.js') // https://highlightjs.org/\n *\n * // Actual default values\n * var md = require('markdown-it')({\n *   highlight: function (str, lang) {\n *     if (lang && hljs.getLanguage(lang)) {\n *       try {\n *         return '<pre class=\"hljs\"><code>' +\n *                hljs.highlight(lang, str, true).value +\n *                '</code></pre>';\n *       } catch (__) {}\n *     }\n *\n *     return '<pre class=\"hljs\"><code>' + md.utils.escapeHtml(str) + '</code></pre>';\n *   }\n * });\n * ```\n *\n **/\nfunction MarkdownIt(presetName, options) {\n  if (!(this instanceof MarkdownIt)) {\n    return new MarkdownIt(presetName, options);\n  }\n\n  if (!options) {\n    if (!utils.isString(presetName)) {\n      options = presetName || {};\n      presetName = 'default';\n    }\n  }\n\n  /**\n   * MarkdownIt#inline -> ParserInline\n   *\n   * Instance of [[ParserInline]].
