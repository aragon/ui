## Develop

The `devbox/` directory contains an app that can be used to develop components.

To develop using it, you have to link aragonUI first:

```console
# Assuming you are in the root aragon-ui directory (i.e. cd aragon-ui/)

# Link @aragon/ui locally and into the devbox package
yarn link
cd devbox/
yarn link @aragon/ui
cd ../

# Rebuild on change
yarn dev
```

And launch the devbox development server:

```console
# shell session 2
yarn devbox
```
